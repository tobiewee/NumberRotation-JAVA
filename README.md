# NumberRotation-JAVA
The task is to rotate the given sequence in such a way that the number of numbers whose values are equal to their position in the sequence is maximised.  First line of the input contains number of tests t (t≤1000). Each test consists of two lines: the first line contains single integer n (n≤100); the next line contains n integers from range 1..n.  For each test print a sequence which fulfills requirements introduced above.
